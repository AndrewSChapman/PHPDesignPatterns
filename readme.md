# PHP Design Patterns

This repository implements some common design patterns in PHP.  These implementations are
not intended for production use, however if you see something you like feel free to go for it.

## Currently Implemented Patterns

* Active Record

## Getting Started
Rename config.temp.ini to config.ini and then adjust the parameters as required.  
Please note that Postgres is the only RDMS currently supported however it would be trivial
to add support for other systems such as MySQL or SQLite.
